This is an implementation of the Towers of Hanoi problem in x86 assembly. I
wrote this to learn more about x86.

There are two files, `hanoi.c` which builds `hanoi-c`, and `hanoi.s` which
builds `hanoi-asm`. You can build both programs with `make`.

I first wrote `hanoi.c` to verify the correctness of my algorithm. Then I tried
to implement the exact same algorithm in `hanoi.s`.
